## 2. Asset Identification and Cataloging

### Hardware Assets
| Asset ID | Asset Type | Quantity | Estimated Value | Location |
|----------|------------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| HW-01 | Servers (Primary Data Center) | 12 | SR180,000 | Main Office |
| HW-02 | Employee Workstations | 140 | SR280,000 | Various Locations |
| HW-03 | Network Infrastructure | 25 | SR95,000 | Main Office & Branch |

### Software Assets
| Asset ID | Software Name | Type | Annual License Cost | Critical Level |
|----------|---------------|------|---------------------|----------------|
| SW-01 | Customer Database System | Core Application | SR45,000 | High |
| SW-02 | Development Environment | Internal Tool | SR25,000 | High |
| SW-03 | Cloud Management Platform | Infrastructure | SR60,000 | Critical |

### Data Assets
| Asset ID | Data Type | Sensitivity | Estimated Value | Protection Required |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| DA-01 | Customer Personal Information | High | SR500,000 | Encrypted, Access Controlled |

## 3. Risk Assessment Matrix

### Threat Identification
| Threat ID | Threat Description | Potential Impact | Likelihood | Severity |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|------------|----------|
| T-01 | Data Breach | High Financial/Reputational Damage | Medium | High |
| T-02 | Ransomware Attack | System Disruption | Low | Critical |
| T-03 | Insider Threat | Unauthorized Data Access | Medium | High |
| T-04 | DDoS Attack | Service Interruption | Low | Medium |

### Risk Calculation Example
**Asset**: Customer Database System (SW-01)
- Asset Value: SR250,000
- Threat: Data Breach
- Vulnerability: Weak Access Controls

**Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) Calculation**:
- Probability of Breach: 15%
- Estimated Loss: SR250,000 * 0.15 = SR37,500
- **SLE**: SR37,500

**Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) Calculation**:
- Estimated Occurrences per Year: 0.5
- **ALE**: SR37,500 * 0.5 = SR18,750

## 4. Incident Response Plan

### Incident Classification Levels
1. **Level 1 (Low)**: Minor security events, no immediate threat
2. **Level 2 (Medium)**: Potential security compromise
3. **Level 3 (High)**: Active security breach

### Response Workflow
1. **Detection**
   - Automated monitoring systems
   - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) alerts
   - Employee reporting mechanisms

2. **Containment**
   - Immediate isolation of affected systems
   - Network segmentation
   - Access revocation

3. **Eradication**
   - Malware removal
   - Vulnerability patching
   - System restoration from clean backups

4. **Recovery**
   - System validation
   - Gradual service restoration
   - Comprehensive system checks

### Communication Protocol
- **Internal Notification**: Within 1 hour of confirmation
- **Customer Notification**: Within 24 hours of assessment
- **Regulatory Reporting**: As per GDPR/CCPA guidelines

## 5. Disaster Recovery Plan

### Recovery Objectives
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours for critical systems
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum 1-hour data loss

### Backup Strategy
1. **Primary Data Center Backup**
   - Location: Austin, Texas
   - Frequency: Real-time incremental
   - Storage: Encrypted cloud storage

2. **Secondary Backup Site**
   - Location: Dallas, Texas
   - Synchronization: Daily full backup
   - Isolated network environment

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Immediate Switchover**
2. **Data Restoration**
3. **System Validation**
4. **Gradual Service Resumption**

## 6. Business Continuity Plan

### Critical Business Functions
1. Customer Service Portal
2. Development Environments
3. Billing and Invoicing Systems
4. Customer Data Management

### Continuity Strategies
- **Remote Work Enablement**
  - 100% cloud-based infrastructure
